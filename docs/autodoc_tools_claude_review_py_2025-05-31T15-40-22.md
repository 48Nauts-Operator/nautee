# Claude Code Review Tool

A Python utility for performing automated code reviews using Anthropic's Claude AI. This tool can review individual files or analyze Git diffs to provide structured feedback on code quality, bugs, and improvements.

## Overview

**Author:** Andr√© Wolke  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-31

This script leverages Claude AI to perform comprehensive code reviews, supporting two primary modes of operation:
- Manual file review for specific files
- Automated Git diff analysis

## Features

- **Dual Review Modes**: Review specific files or Git diffs
- **Markdown Output**: Generates structured, readable review reports
- **Intelligent Git Diff**: Automatically tries multiple Git diff strategies
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files and Git errors
- **Timestamped Output**: Organized review files with timestamps

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Optional, defaults to specified model
```

### Required Tools

- **Git**: Must be available in your system PATH for diff functionality
- **Python 3.6+**: Required for f-string support and modern syntax

## Usage

### Mode 1: Manual File Review

Review one or more specific files:

```bash
python review_script.py file1.py file2.py
```

**Example:**
```bash
python review_script.py src/main.py utils/helper.py
```

### Mode 2: Git Diff Review

Review changes in your Git repository:

```bash
python review_script.py
```

The script automatically attempts the following Git diff strategies in order:
1. `git diff origin/main...HEAD` - Compare with origin/main branch
2. `git diff HEAD^` - Compare with previous commit
3. Generate stub output if no Git history is available

## Output

### File Structure

All reviews are saved to the `output/` directory with the following naming convention:

```
output/claude_review_{identifier}_{timestamp}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `claude_review_main_py_utils_py_2025-05-31T14-30-15.md`
- `claude_review_git_diff_origin_main_2025-05-31T14-30-15.md`

### Review Content

Generated reviews focus on:

- **Bug Detection**: Identification of logic errors and potential issues
- **Code Clarity**: Readability and maintainability suggestions  
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Performance and best practice suggestions
- **Style Consistency**: Code formatting and convention adherence

## Error Handling

### Missing Files
- Non-existent files are skipped with warning messages
- Review continues with available files

### Git Errors
- Graceful fallback between Git diff strategies
- Generates stub output when no Git history is available
- Prevents CI/CD pipeline failures

### API Errors
- Claude API errors are caught and reported
- Script exits with error code 1 for proper CI integration

## Configuration

### Model Selection

Customize the Claude model by setting the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable:

```env
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229
```

### Token Limits

The current configuration uses a maximum of 1,500 tokens for responses. Modify the `max_tokens` parameter in the code to adjust:

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model=model,
    max_tokens=1500,  # Adjust as needed
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
```

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Code Review with Claude
  run: python review_script.py
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
python review_script.py $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')
```

## Limitations

- **Python Files Only**: Currently optimized for Python code review
- **Token Constraints**: Large diffs may be truncated due to API token limits
- **API Dependency**: Requires active Anthropic API access
- **Git Dependency**: Git diff mode requires Git repository context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

**"API key not found" errors:**
- Verify `.env` file exists and contains `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Ensure `.env` file is in the same directory as the script

**Git diff failures:**
- Ensure you're running the script within a Git repository
- Check that you have commit history available

### Debug Mode

Add debug output by modifying the script to include verbose logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
