Yes — that’s a very smart and robust setup. Here’s a breakdown and a few improvements to sharpen the architecture you’re envisioning:

⸻

✅ Your Future Setup: Overview

🧑‍💻 Main IDE: Cursor
	•	Primary development + editing
	•	Multi-model inline assistant (Claude 3, GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.)
	•	Use Claude 3 Sonnet or Opus for:
	•	Inline code review
	•	Explaining changes
	•	Suggested refactors
	•	Generating or rewriting tests
	•	Acts as your first line of feedback during development

⸻

🧠 Claude Code: Background Review Layer
	•	Triggered on file save, folder audit, or code checkpoint
	•	Excludes *test*, *.spec.js, __mocks__, etc.
	•	Runs in batch mode (e.g. per module or folder), such as:

python review_folder.py ./src --model claude-sonnet


	•	Outputs:
	•	Markdown summaries (output/reviews/)
	•	Structured feedback per file (violations, duplication, architecture issues)
	•	Optional diffs or “action suggestions”

This is your agentic sanity check — lower noise, deeper understanding

⸻

⛓️ Post-Git Check-In: Nautee x Claude SDK

After code is pushed to Git or merged into a branch:

🔄 Hook via:
	•	Git post-commit
	•	GitHub/GitLab webhook
	•	CI pipeline trigger

🤖 Nautee + Claude SDK perform:
	1.	End-to-End Diff Review (e.g. main vs dev)
	2.	Change Risk Classification (minor, major, critical)
	3.	Documentation Check (has readme, schema updated, version bump)
	4.	Cross-Repo or Dependency Checks (if needed)
	5.	Security/Wildcode Audit (flag common red flags)
	6.	Summary Note to PR or Slack/ClickUp/Obsidian

This is your automated post-check-in watchdog — and where you can build a dev memory layer (e.g., “last time we changed this function, tests broke”).

⸻

🧱 Layered Review Architecture

Layer	Trigger	Agent	Output	Goal
1️⃣ Cursor Inline	On edit	Claude / GPT	Inline help	Dev-time velocity
2️⃣ Folder Batch	On save / manual	Claude	Markdown review	Offline quality gate
3️⃣ Post-Commit	On push / merge	Nautee + Claude SDK	Logs, PR comments	Risk, doc, and cross-cutting check


⸻

🧩 Optional Enhancements
	•	Claude Memory Agent → Tracks patterns across PRs (recurring issues, frequently touched modules)
	•	Log Aggregator → Streams markdown reviews into Notion, Obsidian, or a dashboard
	•	Auto-Ticketing → Connects to ClickUp to auto-create “Review Fix” tickets for critical findings
	•	Reviewer Persona Tuning → Have “Strict Claude” vs. “Suggestive Claude” modes

⸻

🚀 Final Setup Summary

[1] Cursor IDE: 
    - Real-time assistant, safe by design
    - Claude Sonnet for trusted day-to-day help

[2] Local Batch Reviews (pre-check-in):
    - Claude Sonnet or Opus 
    - Runs on demand or auto via folder triggers
    - Logs in /output/reviews

[3] Git Post-Check-in:
    - Nautee hooks
    - Claude SDK pipeline for PR review, security, documentation checks

→ Full dev flow covered with two Claude layers 
→ Human-in-the-loop optional
→ Compatible with agent chains and memory tracing

# Adding LiteLLM
Exactly — using LiteLLM behind Nautee is not just a great idea, it’s a perfect strategic match for your architecture.

⸻

🤖 Why LiteLLM Behind Nautee Is a Strong Move

🔌 1. Unified Abstraction Over Claude + Others

LiteLLM gives you:
	•	One consistent API for Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Mistral, and more
	•	Easy switching of models without touching business logic
	•	Claude-compatible endpoints with streaming, retries, logging

So you can plug Claude Code into Nautee, and later test alternatives like GPT-4o, Mistral, or even local LLMs — all without rewriting Nautee logic.

⸻

🧠 2. Smart Routing and Fallbacks

You can configure:
	•	Claude Opus for deep reviews
	•	Claude Sonnet for faster diff checks
	•	Fallbacks to GPT-4o or Mistral if Anthropic API fails or rate-limits

model_list = [
  {"model_name": "claude-sonnet", "litellm_provider": "anthropic"},
  {"model_name": "gpt-4o", "litellm_provider": "openai"},
]

This gives Nautee high availability + flexibility.

⸻

🔐 3. Local Proxying + Token Auditing

Nautee can route all LLM traffic through your local LiteLLM instance, giving you:
	•	Centralized logging and analytics
	•	Easy API key rotation
	•	OpenTelemetry hooks to trace prompts/results

Ideal for:
	•	Security audits
	•	Cost analysis
	•	Rate limit management

⸻

🧩 4. Multi-Agent Chains

LiteLLM can also help orchestrate:
	•	Sequential reviews (Claude → GPT → JSON filter)
	•	Persona routing (e.g. “Strict Reviewer” → Opus, “Creative Tweaker” → GPT-4o)

Nautee can plug into this flow to:
	•	Send a repo diff
	•	Get multiple takes from different models
	•	Merge insights or flag disagreements

⸻

🛠 Practical Example Setup

Step 1: Run LiteLLM Locally

litellm --port 4000

Step 2: Configure Nautee to Use It

from nautee.agents import ClaudeReviewer
from nautee.config import settings

settings.LLM_API_BASE = "http://localhost:4000"
settings.MODEL_NAME = "claude-3-sonnet"

agent = ClaudeReviewer()
agent.review_diff("main", "dev")

Step 3: Add a FastAPI wrapper for external calls

You can expose a REST endpoint like:

POST /nautee/review
Body: { repo_path, base_branch, target_branch }
