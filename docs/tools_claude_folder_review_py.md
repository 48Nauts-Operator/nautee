# Claude Folder Reviewer Documentation

## Overview

The **Claude Folder Reviewer** is a Python script that automates code review processes by scanning directories for source files and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive structural analysis and insights.

## Purpose

This tool is designed to help developers get AI-powered code reviews for entire project folders. It focuses on identifying:

- Code organization issues
- Bug patterns and potential problems
- Architecture weaknesses
- Suggestions for better modularization and code clarity

## Key Features

- **Recursive folder scanning** for source files
- **Batch processing** with visual progress tracking
- **AI-powered analysis** using Claude API
- **Markdown output** for easy reading and sharing
- **Multiple language support** (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the same directory:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py [folder_path]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Review current directory
python claude_folder_reviewer.py .

# Review specific folder
python claude_folder_reviewer.py /path/to/project

# Use default folder (../137docs)
python claude_folder_reviewer.py
```

## Functions Reference

### `render_progress(current, total, width=30)`

Creates a visual progress bar for tracking file processing.

**Parameters:**
- `current` (int): Current number of processed files
- `total` (int): Total number of files to process
- `width` (int): Character width of the progress bar

**Returns:**
- String representation of progress bar with percentage

**Example Output:**
```
[████████████████████------] 67%
```

### `estimate_valid_files(folder, valid_exts)`

Recursively discovers all source files in the specified directory.

**Parameters:**
- `folder` (str): Root directory to scan
- `valid_exts` (tuple): File extensions to include

**Returns:**
- List of full file paths matching the criteria

**Supported Extensions:**
- `.py` - Python files
- `.js` - JavaScript files
- `.ts` - TypeScript files
- `.tsx` - TypeScript React files
- `.jsx` - JavaScript React files

### `main()`

The primary execution function that orchestrates the entire review process:

1. **Environment Setup** - Loads API credentials and configuration
2. **File Discovery** - Scans target folder for valid source files
3. **Content Aggregation** - Reads and combines all source files
4. **AI Analysis** - Sends combined content to Claude API
5. **Output Generation** - Saves review to timestamped Markdown file

## Output

### File Location
Reviews are saved to: `output/folder_review_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.md`

### Content Structure
The generated Markdown file contains:
- Code organization analysis
- Identified bug patterns
- Architecture recommendations
- Modularization suggestions

## Configuration Options

### Supported Models
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (default)
- Other Claude models supported by the Anthropic API

### Customizable Parameters
- **Token Limit**: Currently set to 2000 tokens
- **File Extensions**: Modify `valid_exts` tuple in `main()`
- **Output Directory**: Change from `output/` if needed

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for:

- **Missing API Key**: Graceful failure with clear error message
- **File Read Errors**: Individual file failures don't stop the process
- **API Errors**: Network and API issues are caught and reported
- **Empty Directories**: Warns when no valid files are found

## Performance Features

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar with ETA calculation
- **Timing Information**: Shows total processing time
- **File Summary**: Lists all successfully reviewed files

## Limitations & Considerations

### Token Limits
- Large codebases may exceed Claude's context window
- Consider breaking very large projects into smaller chunks

### API Costs
- Each review consumes Claude API tokens
- Monitor usage for cost management

### File Size Limits
- Very large individual files may cause memory issues
- Consider excluding generated files or large data files

## Best Practices

### Recommended Usage
- Run on clean, committed code for accurate analysis
- Exclude build artifacts and dependencies
- Review output thoroughly before implementing suggestions

### Performance Tips
- Use `.gitignore` patterns to exclude unnecessary files
- Consider running on specific subdirectories for large projects
- Monitor API rate limits for batch processing

## Example Output Structure

```markdown
# Code Review Results

## Architecture Analysis
- Overall project structure assessment
- Module organization recommendations

## Bug Patterns
- Potential issues identified
- Security considerations

## Improvement Suggestions
- Refactoring opportunities
- Code quality enhancements
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

2. **No Files Found**
   - Check folder path and file extensions
   - Verify folder contains supported file types

3. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Implement delays between requests for large projects
   - Consider upgrading API plan
