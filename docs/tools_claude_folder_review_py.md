# Claude Folder Reviewer Documentation

## Overview

The **Claude Folder Reviewer** is a Python script that automatically analyzes entire codebases by scanning source files in a specified folder and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive code review insights. The tool generates structured feedback in Markdown format, focusing on code organization, potential bugs, architectural issues, and improvement suggestions.

## Purpose

This tool is designed for developers and teams who want to:
- Get automated code reviews of entire projects
- Identify architectural weaknesses and patterns
- Receive suggestions for code organization and modularization
- Analyze code quality across multiple files simultaneously

## Key Features

- **Recursive file scanning** for multiple programming languages
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars and ETA calculations  
- **Batch processing** of source files into a single Claude API request
- **Automated output generation** with timestamped Markdown reports
- **Error handling** for file reading and API communication

## Supported File Types

The script currently supports the following file extensions:
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.ts` (TypeScript)
- `.tsx` (TypeScript React)
- `.jsx` (JavaScript React)

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Optional, defaults to this model
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py [folder_path]
```

### Examples
```bash
# Review current directory's parent folder (default)
python claude_folder_reviewer.py

# Review specific folder
python claude_folder_reviewer.py /path/to/your/project

# Review relative path
python claude_folder_reviewer.py ../my-project
```

## Important Functions

### `render_progress(current, total, width=30)`
Generates a visual progress bar for tracking file processing.

**Parameters:**
- `current` (int): Current number of processed files
- `total` (int): Total number of files to process  
- `width` (int): Character width of the progress bar

**Returns:** Formatted progress bar string with percentage

### `estimate_valid_files(folder, valid_exts)`
Recursively scans a directory tree to find all files with valid extensions.

**Parameters:**
- `folder` (str): Root directory path to scan
- `valid_exts` (tuple): Tuple of acceptable file extensions

**Returns:** List of full file paths matching the criteria

### `main()`
The primary function that orchestrates the entire review process:
1. Sets up environment and API client
2. Scans for valid source files
3. Reads and combines file contents
4. Sends batch request to Claude API
5. Saves the generated review to an output file

## Output

The script generates timestamped Markdown files in the `output/` directory with the naming pattern:
```
output/folder_review_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.md
```

The review includes:
- Code organization analysis
- Identified bug patterns
- Architecture weakness assessment
- Modularization and clarity suggestions

## Notes and Suggestions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **API Costs**: Each run makes a single API call to Claude with potentially large amounts of code. Monitor your Anthropic API usage.
- **Token Limits**: Large codebases may exceed Claude's token limits. Consider breaking down very large projects.
- **File Encoding**: The script assumes UTF-8 encoding for all source files.

### üîß Potential Improvements

1. **Add configuration file support** for customizing file extensions and exclusions
2. **Implement file size limits** to prevent overwhelming the API
3. **Add support for ignoring certain directories** (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`)
4. **Include error recovery** for partial failures
5. **Add summary statistics** (lines of code, file counts by type)

### üí° Usage Tips

- Run on clean, committed code for the most accurate reviews
- Use on smaller projects initially to understand output quality
- Consider running on specific subdirectories for focused reviews
- Keep the `output/` folder for tracking review history over time

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:
- Missing or invalid API keys
- File reading permissions
- Empty directories
- Claude API communication errors

Errors are displayed with clear emoji indicators and descriptive messages.
