# Claude Folder Reviewer

## Overview

The **Claude Folder Reviewer** is a Python script that automates code review processes by scanning entire directories for source files and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive structural analysis and insights.

## Purpose

This tool helps developers:
- **Analyze code organization** across multiple files
- **Identify bug patterns** and potential issues
- **Discover architecture weaknesses** in project structure
- **Get suggestions** for better modularization and code clarity

## Features

- üîç **Recursive file scanning** with support for multiple programming languages
- üìä **Real-time progress tracking** with ETA estimates
- ü§ñ **AI-powered code analysis** using Claude
- üìù **Markdown output** for easy reading and sharing
- ‚ö° **Batch processing** for efficient review of entire codebases

## Supported File Types

The script currently supports the following file extensions:
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.ts` (TypeScript)
- `.tsx` (TypeScript JSX)
- `.jsx` (JavaScript JSX)

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Optional, defaults to this model
```

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py [folder_path]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Review current directory
python claude_folder_reviewer.py .

# Review specific folder
python claude_folder_reviewer.py /path/to/project

# Review default folder (../137docs)
python claude_folder_reviewer.py
```

## Key Functions

### `render_progress(current, total, width=30)`

Creates a visual progress bar for tracking file processing.

**Parameters:**
- `current` (int): Current progress count
- `total` (int): Total items to process  
- `width` (int): Width of progress bar in characters

**Returns:** Formatted progress bar string with percentage

### `estimate_valid_files(folder, valid_exts)`

Recursively discovers all valid source files in the target directory.

**Parameters:**
- `folder` (str): Root directory to search
- `valid_exts` (tuple): Acceptable file extensions

**Returns:** List of full file paths

### `main()`

The primary execution function that orchestrates the entire review process:

1. **Environment Setup** - Loads API credentials and configuration
2. **File Discovery** - Scans directory for valid source files
3. **Content Aggregation** - Reads and combines all source files
4. **AI Analysis** - Sends combined content to Claude for review
5. **Output Generation** - Saves review results to timestamped Markdown file

## Output

The script generates timestamped Markdown files in the `output/` directory:

```
output/folder_review_2024-01-15T14-30-25.md
```

Each review includes:
- **Code Organization Analysis**
- **Bug Pattern Detection**
- **Architecture Assessment**
- **Improvement Recommendations**

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for:
- Missing or invalid API keys
- File read permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid directory paths

## Performance Features

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar with ETA estimates
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple files
- **Timing Metrics**: Total processing time reporting

## Notes and Suggestions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **API Costs**: Each review consumes Claude API tokens - monitor usage for large codebases
- **File Size Limits**: Very large codebases may exceed Claude's token limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing delays for extremely large projects

### üîß Potential Improvements

- Add support for more file types (`.java`, `.cpp`, `.go`, etc.)
- Implement file size filtering to avoid processing very large files
- Add configuration file support for custom settings
- Include option to exclude certain directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`)
- Add support for different output formats (JSON, HTML)

### üí° Usage Tips

- Start with smaller projects to understand output format
- Review the generated Markdown files in a proper viewer for best experience
- Consider breaking very large projects into smaller chunks
- Use the tool regularly during development cycles for continuous improvement

## Example Output Structure

The generated reviews typically include sections like:

```markdown
# Code Review Summary

## Overall Architecture
- Analysis of project structure...

## Code Organization
- File organization patterns...

## Potential Issues
- Bug patterns identified...

## Recommendations
- Specific improvement suggestions...
