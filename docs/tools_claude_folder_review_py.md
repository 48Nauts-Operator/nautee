# Claude Folder Reviewer Documentation

## Overview

The **Claude Folder Reviewer** is a Python script that automates code review processes by scanning directories for source files and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive structural code insights. The tool combines multiple source files into a single prompt and generates detailed Markdown reports focusing on code quality and architecture improvements.

## Purpose

This script serves as an automated code review assistant that helps developers:

- **Analyze entire codebases** at once rather than reviewing files individually
- **Identify structural issues** and architectural weaknesses
- **Receive AI-powered suggestions** for code organization improvements
- **Generate comprehensive reports** in Markdown format for documentation

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Multi-language support** for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files
- ‚úÖ **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars and ETA estimates
- ‚úÖ **Batch processing** of entire directory structures
- ‚úÖ **Timestamped output** files for version control
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** for file reading and API interactions

## Functions

### `render_progress(current: int, total: int, width: int = 30) -> str`

Creates a visual progress bar for tracking file processing status.

**Parameters:**
- `current`: Current number of processed files
- `total`: Total number of files to process
- `width`: Character width of the progress bar (default: 30)

**Returns:** Formatted progress bar string with percentage

```python
# Example output: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà------] 65%
```

### `estimate_valid_files(folder: str, valid_exts: tuple) -> list`

Recursively scans a directory tree to find all source files with valid extensions.

**Parameters:**
- `folder`: Root directory path to scan
- `valid_exts`: Tuple of acceptable file extensions

**Returns:** List of full file paths for all discovered source files

### `main()`

The primary execution function that orchestrates the entire review process:

1. **Environment Setup**: Loads API credentials and configuration
2. **File Discovery**: Scans target directory for source files
3. **Content Aggregation**: Reads and combines all source files
4. **AI Analysis**: Sends combined content to Claude for review
5. **Report Generation**: Saves the review as a timestamped Markdown file

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the script directory with the following variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Optional, has default
```

### Supported File Extensions

The script currently processes files with these extensions:
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.ts` (TypeScript)
- `.tsx` (TypeScript React)
- `.jsx` (JavaScript React)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py [folder_path]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Review current directory
python claude_folder_reviewer.py .

# Review specific project folder
python claude_folder_reviewer.py /path/to/my/project

# Use default folder (../137docs)
python claude_folder_reviewer.py
```

## Output

### Console Output
- Real-time progress tracking with visual progress bars
- ETA estimates for completion
- File-by-file processing status
- Summary of reviewed files

### Generated Files
Reports are saved to `output/folder_review_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.md`

## Review Focus Areas

The AI analysis concentrates on:

- **Code Organization**: Structure, modularity, and file organization
- **Bug Patterns**: Common anti-patterns and potential issues
- **Architecture Weaknesses**: Design flaws and scalability concerns
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Recommendations for improvement

## Requirements

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Valid Anthropic API key
- Internet connection for API calls

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for:
- **Missing API credentials**
- **File reading permissions**
- **API rate limiting**
- **Network connectivity issues**
- **Invalid directory paths**

## Notes and Suggestions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **API Costs**: Each review consumes Claude API tokens - monitor usage for large codebases
- **File Size Limits**: Very large codebases may exceed Claude's token limits
- **Security**: Ensure sensitive code is not inadvertently sent to external APIs

### üîß Potential Improvements

- Add configuration file support for custom file extensions
- Implement file size filtering to avoid token limit issues
- Add support for excluding specific directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`)
- Include option to split large codebases into multiple reviews
- Add caching mechanism to avoid re-reviewing unchanged files

### üí° Best Practices

- Run reviews on clean, committed code for consistent results
- Use specific folder paths rather than entire repositories
- Review the generated reports alongside your development team
- Consider running reviews at major development milestones
