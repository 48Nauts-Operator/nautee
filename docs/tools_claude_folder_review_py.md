# Claude Folder Reviewer

## Overview

The **Claude Folder Reviewer** is a Python script that automates code review processes by scanning entire directories for source files and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive structural analysis and insights.

## Purpose

This tool is designed to help developers get high-level feedback on their codebase by:

- **Analyzing code organization** and structure
- **Identifying potential bug patterns** and issues
- **Highlighting architecture weaknesses** 
- **Providing suggestions** for better modularization and code clarity
- **Generating reports** in readable Markdown format

## Key Features

- üîç **Recursive file scanning** with configurable file type filtering
- üìä **Real-time progress tracking** with visual progress bars and ETA estimates
- ü§ñ **AI-powered analysis** using Claude's advanced language model
- üìù **Markdown output** with timestamped reports
- ‚ö° **Batch processing** of multiple source files in a single API call

## Functions

### `render_progress(current: int, total: int, width: int = 30) -> str`

Creates a visual progress bar to track file processing.

**Parameters:**
- `current`: Number of files processed so far
- `total`: Total number of files to process
- `width`: Character width of the progress bar (default: 30)

**Returns:** Formatted progress bar string with percentage

```python
# Example output: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà------] 75%
```

### `estimate_valid_files(folder: str, valid_exts: tuple) -> list`

Recursively discovers all source files in a directory tree.

**Parameters:**
- `folder`: Root directory path to scan
- `valid_exts`: Tuple of acceptable file extensions

**Returns:** List of full file paths matching the criteria

### `main()`

The primary execution function that orchestrates the entire review process:

1. **Environment Setup** - Loads API credentials and configuration
2. **File Discovery** - Scans target directory for source files
3. **Content Aggregation** - Reads and combines all source files
4. **AI Analysis** - Sends batch request to Claude API
5. **Report Generation** - Saves results to timestamped Markdown file

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Optional, has default
```

### Supported File Types

By default, the script processes these file extensions:
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.ts` (TypeScript)
- `.tsx` (TypeScript React)
- `.jsx` (JavaScript React)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py [folder_path]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Review current directory's parent folder
python claude_folder_reviewer.py ../my_project

# Review default folder (../137docs)
python claude_folder_reviewer.py
```

## Output

The script generates timestamped Markdown reports in the `output/` directory:

```
output/folder_review_2024-01-15T14-30-45.md
```

Reports include:
- Detailed code analysis
- Architecture recommendations
- Bug pattern identification
- Modularization suggestions

## Requirements

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

## Notes and Suggestions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **API Costs**: Be mindful that large codebases will consume more Claude API tokens
- **File Size Limits**: Very large files may exceed Claude's context window
- **Rate Limiting**: The script doesn't implement rate limiting for API calls

### üîß Potential Improvements

1. **Add token counting** to estimate costs before sending requests
2. **Implement chunking strategy** for very large codebases
3. **Add configuration file** support for custom file extensions
4. **Include filtering options** to exclude certain directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`)
5. **Add retry logic** for API failures
6. **Support multiple output formats** (JSON, HTML, etc.)

### üí° Usage Tips

- Start with smaller projects to understand the output format
- Review the generated reports to fine-tune your codebase before major releases
- Use the tool regularly during development cycles for continuous feedback
- Consider integrating into CI/CD pipelines for automated code reviews

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for:
- Missing or invalid files
- API connection issues
- File reading permissions
- Invalid directory paths

Errors are displayed with descriptive emoji indicators for quick identification.
