# Claude Folder Reviewer

## Overview

The Claude Folder Reviewer is a Python script that automatically analyzes entire codebases by scanning source files in a directory and leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to provide comprehensive code review insights. The tool generates detailed Markdown reports focusing on code organization, potential bugs, architectural issues, and improvement suggestions.

## Purpose

This script is designed to:
- **Automate code reviews** for entire project folders
- **Identify structural issues** and architectural weaknesses
- **Provide actionable insights** for code improvement
- **Generate documentation-ready reports** in Markdown format
- **Save time** on manual code review processes

## Key Features

- 🔍 **Recursive file scanning** with configurable file extensions
- 📊 **Real-time progress tracking** with visual progress bars
- ⚡ **Batch processing** of multiple source files
- 🤖 **AI-powered analysis** using Claude's advanced language model
- 📝 **Markdown output** for easy documentation integration
- ⏱️ **ETA estimation** for long-running reviews

## Functions

### `render_progress(current: int, total: int, width: int = 30) -> str`

Creates a visual progress bar for tracking file processing.

**Parameters:**
- `current`: Number of files processed
- `total`: Total number of files to process
- `width`: Character width of the progress bar (default: 30)

**Returns:** Formatted progress bar string with percentage

```python
# Example output: [████████████████████----------] 67%
```

### `estimate_valid_files(folder: str, valid_exts: tuple) -> list`

Recursively discovers all source files with valid extensions in the target directory.

**Parameters:**
- `folder`: Root directory path to scan
- `valid_exts`: Tuple of acceptable file extensions

**Returns:** List of absolute file paths

### `main()`

The primary execution function that orchestrates the entire workflow:

1. **Environment Setup**: Loads API credentials and configuration
2. **File Discovery**: Scans the target folder for source files
3. **Content Aggregation**: Reads and combines all source files
4. **AI Analysis**: Sends combined content to Claude for review
5. **Report Generation**: Saves the analysis as a timestamped Markdown file

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

### Supported File Extensions

The script currently processes these file types:
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.ts` (TypeScript)
- `.tsx` (TypeScript React)
- `.jsx` (JavaScript React)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py /path/to/your/project
```

### Default Behavior

If no folder is specified, the script defaults to scanning `../137docs`:

```bash
python claude_folder_reviewer.py
```

## Output

The script generates timestamped Markdown files in the `output/` directory:

```
output/folder_review_2024-01-15T14-30-25.md
```

### Sample Output Structure

The generated report includes:
- **Code Organization Analysis**
- **Identified Bug Patterns**
- **Architecture Weakness Assessment**
- **Modularization Recommendations**
- **Code Clarity Suggestions**

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for:
- Missing or invalid API keys
- File read permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid file paths
- API response errors

## Performance Considerations

### Notes and Suggestions

- **API Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Anthropic's API rate limits for large codebases
- **Token Limits**: The script uses a 2000 token limit; consider increasing for complex projects
- **File Size**: Large files may impact processing time and API costs
- **Network Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection for API calls

### Optimization Tips

1. **Filter Unnecessary Files**: Consider excluding test files, documentation, or generated code
2. **Batch Size Management**: For very large projects, consider splitting into smaller batches
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for previously analyzed files that haven't changed

## Dependencies

```python
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

## Limitations

- Requires valid Anthropic API key and credits
- Limited by Claude's context window and token limits
- Processing time scales with codebase size
- Network-dependent operation

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- **Configuration files** for custom file extensions and exclusions
- **Incremental analysis** for changed files only
- **Multiple output formats** (JSON, HTML, etc.)
- **Parallel processing** for improved performance
- **Integration hooks** for CI/CD pipelines
